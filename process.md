# POC — custombasketball: build a site, then SEO it, shown live

**Audience: the implementing agent (Codex).** This is a proof of concept, but a
*faithful* one — it builds the design's **MVP proving loop** (a real Maestro
orchestrating real specialists in sandboxes via the job contract), not a toy. Build
the smallest thing that hits the success criteria and *looks* like the design. **The
stack and vendors are locked in §7 — build exactly those, no substitutions.** If
something genuinely isn't covered, ask the user rather than guessing.

---

## 0. This is its own repository

This POC lives in its **own repo**, separate from the tenwhy design-doc site. You're in
it now: `process.md` (this file) + `design/` (the Claude Design bundle — read-only); you
build the app under `app/` (layout in §7).

- This repo is already on GitHub (private):
  **`github.com/moeghashim/custombasketball-poc`**. You're working in a clone of it — if
  you don't have it yet, `git clone https://github.com/moeghashim/custombasketball-poc.git`.
  **Commit and push as you go.** **Do not** add this POC to the tenwhy repo.

### Before you build — verify (don't guess)
- `stripe projects catalog render · neon · blaxel` — confirm the exact service
  refs, **and that your country supports paid provisioning** for them.
- **Blaxel:** how to build + push a custom sandbox image (the Node 20 + Chromium + CLIs
  image) — check the Blaxel docs.
- **Cloudflare Pages:** the non-interactive **direct-upload** flow with `wrangler`
  (`wrangler pages project create` / `wrangler pages deploy ./dist`) and the API-token
  scopes it needs — check the Cloudflare Pages docs.
- The 5 jerseys' demo content (names / designs / prices) is yours to invent — keep it
  plausible.

## 1. What we're proving

One page, one button — **"Create the website"**. Click it and **Maestro** (a real,
always-on orchestrator) runs two specialists in sequence, each **in its own sandbox**,
with the page narrating it all **live**:

1. **Nic** (website builder) → builds **`custombasketball`** with **5 custom jerseys**,
   deploys it to **Cloudflare Pages**, returns a durable live URL.
2. **Max** (SEO) → audits that live site, produces **suggested changes**, hands them
   back to Maestro.

### Success criteria

Done when **all eight** are true — a reviewer checks each by clicking the button once
and watching (plus a peek at Maestro's DB):

1. **One button runs everything.** Click → Maestro runs Nic then Max, no other steps.
2. **Nic builds the store → a real, durable live URL** — `custombasketball`
   with 5 jerseys, deployed to **Cloudflare Pages** and still reachable at its
   `*.pages.dev` URL after the run finishes. *(user #1)*
3. **Max audits that live URL and produces concrete output** — real findings (SEO score
   + specific issues) and a list of **suggested changes**.
4. **Max hands the suggestions to Maestro**, which receives them and acknowledges "would
   execute". Applying the fixes is out of scope. *(user #2)*
5. **Nic and Max are real CLIs that run in Blaxel sandboxes**, fired by Maestro via the
   **job contract** (a signed request → a signed result). Maestro has **no CLI**.
6. **Maestro is real, not a stub:** an always-on service that records every job in
   **Postgres** (a `jobs` state machine + `results`), so a run is durable and
   inspectable.
7. **The round trip is genuine:** Maestro fires a job into a sandbox; the specialist
   **webhooks a signed result back**; Maestro validates, records, and advances.
8. **The page narrates it live** — the `build` then `report` stages of the Process
   Steps v2 design animate from the **real streamed events**, not a canned timer.

---

## 2. The visual — use the design in `./design/`

A Claude Design handoff bundle is in **`design/process/`**. **Read it first**, in
order: `README.md` → `chats/chat1.md` → `project/Process Steps v2.html` → then its
imports (`flow.jsx`, `stages.jsx`, `styles.css`). **Recreate it faithfully** (the
prototype is React-via-Babel, no build step — keep that approach; match the visual).

### How it's wired
`Process Steps v2.html` runs in **`live` mode** — a controller (`createFlowController`,
`flow.jsx`) is driven by *real events*, not a timer. Its demo `backendDemo(c)` simulates
those events; **replace it with a driver fed by Maestro's SSE stream**. Controller API:

| Call | Use |
|---|---|
| `c.activate(stepId)` | mark a step in-progress |
| `c.pushLog(stepId, {kind, text})` | append a terminal line (`kind`: `cmd·ok·arr·dim`) |
| `c.mergeData(stepId, {…})` | set/replace fields (url, kpis, chart, heading…) |
| `c.progress(stepId, n)` | reveal the n-th sub-result |
| `c.complete(stepId)` | mark done; auto-advances |
| `c.restart()` | replay |

### Map Nic and Max onto the stages (`window.STAGES`, `stages.jsx`)
- **Nic → `type: "build"`** (`StageBuild`): browser wireframe assembling + a live
  terminal. Driven by Nic's events: `activate` → a stream of `log`s → `data {url}` →
  `complete`.
- **Max → `type: "report"`** (`StageReport`): audit card with eyebrow, heading, KPIs,
  bar chart, done-badge. Driven by Max's events; `doneLabel: "Handed to Maestro"`.

The **"Create the website" button** does `POST /api/run`, then opens `GET /api/events`
(SSE) and feeds every event into the controller.

---

## 3. Architecture — the MVP proving loop (POC-sized)

This is the design's loop made real (build.html Phase 1–2; design **§9 job contract**,
**§11 durable orchestration**). It cuts only multi-tenancy, auth, the brain repo, and
the plan/apply gate/broker (§4) — **not** the orchestrator, the durable state, the job
contract, or the sandbox.

```
[ Page: Process Steps v2 ] ──click "Create the website"──► POST /api/run
        ▲  GET /api/events (SSE, live)                          │
        │                                                       ▼
[ Maestro — always-on Express + Neon Postgres ]
   jobs/results state machine · job contract · signed webhook
        │  fire job (signed request)                  ▲ signed events + result
        ▼                                             │ (HTTPS webhook)
[ Blaxel sandbox — ephemeral, one per job ]  run `nic build` / `max audit`
        └─ Nic → deploy site to Cloudflare Pages → { url }   Max → Lighthouse(url) → { suggestions }
```

**The round trip, per step:**
1. Maestro inserts a `jobs` row (`queued`), composes the **request** — `{ job_id,
   agent, task, brief, callback_url }` + an HMAC secret — and marks it `dispatched`.
2. Maestro creates an ephemeral **Blaxel sandbox** (`SandboxInstance.createIfNotExists`),
   puts the CLI in it, and `sandbox.process.exec`s `nic build …` / `max audit …` → `running`.
3. The CLI works and **POSTs** its NDJSON progress events + a final **HMAC-signed**
   result envelope to `callback_url` (Maestro's webhook). This is the design's "µVM
   webhooks back," exactly.
4. Maestro verifies the signature, writes `results`, relays each event to the page over
   SSE, sets `succeeded`/`failed`, deletes the sandbox, and **advances** to the next step.
5. After Max: Maestro holds the suggestions and acknowledges "would execute".

### Maestro — the orchestrator (real, thin only where it can be)
- **Always-on Express service. No CLI.** It owns the run.
- **Durable job state in Neon Postgres** (provisioned via Stripe Projects): a `jobs`
  table with a real state machine — `queued → dispatched → running → {succeeded ·
  failed · timed_out}` — and a `results` table. A run survives a restart and is
  inspectable. (The §11 control plane, shrunk: state machine + the two tables, no
  outbox/leases/reconciliation yet.)
- **The job contract:** fires each specialist with a structured **request** and accepts
  a structured, **HMAC-signed response** at its webhook — same shape as design §9.
- **Fires specialists into Blaxel sandboxes** (next), waits for the signed result,
  validates + records it, advances.
- **Deployed, not local.** Maestro runs as a **Render web service** (provisioned via
  Stripe Projects), so it has a stable public URL — the Blaxel sandboxes post their signed
  results straight to it, no tunnel. Render's env carries the Stripe Projects creds (Neon,
  Blaxel) plus the Cloudflare Pages creds (`CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`, `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`).

### Building the CLIs (Nic & Max)
Nic and Max are the two **tools**, built as **CLIs** — the unit of work in tenwhy
(`https://tenwhy.pages.dev/tool`, `CONTRACT.md`). For the POC, build a **minimal**
version of that contract — do **not** build the full `agent-cli-kit` first; a tiny
shared helper is enough. Note in comments where the real version differs.

- **Stack:** TypeScript on Node 20, run via **`tsx`**, bundled to one file each (esbuild).
  Live under `app/tools/` — `nic`, `max`.
- **One Blaxel image for both:** bake a single sandbox image — `node:20-slim` + Chromium
  (Max needs it) + both CLI bundles — and run every job's sandbox from it; Maestro execs
  `nic build` or `max audit`. (Production uses one image per tool; the POC shares one so
  there's a single image to build + push.)
- **Invocation (inside the sandbox):**
  ```
  nic build --brief '<json>'      # { job_id, callback_url, … }; HMAC secret via env
  max audit --brief '<json>'      # { job_id, callback_url, url, … }
  ```
- **Transport = the job contract, not stdout.** Each CLI **POSTs** to `callback_url`
  (signed with the per-job HMAC secret) as it works:
  ```
  POST {callback_url}   { "job_id": "…", "event": { "event":"log", "step":"build", "kind":"ok", "text":"built in 4.18s" } }
  POST {callback_url}   { "job_id": "…", "event": { "event":"data", "step":"build", "patch": { "url":"https://…" } } }
  … then the final result …
  POST {callback_url}   { "job_id": "…", "result": { "ok":true, "tool":"nic", "command":"build",
                                                     "data": { "url":"https://…" }, "error":null, "meta": {…} } }
  ```
  Event shapes map 1:1 to the page controller (`activate→c.activate`, `log→c.pushLog`,
  `data→c.mergeData`, `progress→c.progress`, `complete→c.complete`). `step` = `build`
  for Nic, `report` for Max. (CLIs may *also* print NDJSON to stdout for local debugging.)
- **POC cuts for the CLIs:** skip `--describe`, the full flag set, plan/apply gate/broker.
  **Keep:** the `{ok,data,error,meta}` result + the signed event stream — that's what
  keeps them faithful to the contract and the page live.

### Nic — the website builder
- CLI `nic build`, running inside its **Blaxel** sandbox. Generates **`custombasketball`**
  — a static store with **5 custom jerseys** from a **hard-coded template** + placeholder
  imagery (no LLM).
- **Deploys the built `./dist` to Cloudflare Pages** via `wrangler` direct upload
  (`CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` + `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` injected by Maestro). Use a per-run
  project name `cb-<job_id>` (DNS-safe slug): `wrangler pages project create <project>
  --production-branch=main` (idempotent — ignore "already exists") → `wrangler pages deploy
  ./dist --project-name=<project> --branch=main` (run with `CI=true`). The durable URL is
  **deterministic** — `https://<project>.pages.dev` — served from Cloudflare's CDN, so it
  stays reachable after the run for Max to audit and the demo to show. Before returning,
  poll the URL until it serves 200 (so Max never audits a not-yet-live URL).
- Emits `log` events through generate + deploy, a `data {url}` patch with the Pages URL,
  then the final result `{ url }`.

### Max — the SEO specialist
- CLI `max audit --brief '{… url …}'`, running inside its **Blaxel** sandbox. Runs
  **Lighthouse** (`lighthouse` + `chrome-launcher`) against the Cloudflare Pages URL → the **SEO
  category score** + the failing audits.
- **Why a Chrome-capable image:** Lighthouse doesn't read HTML — it *loads the page in a
  real headless Chromium* and measures it (that's where the SEO/perf/a11y scores come
  from). So the sandbox's container image must contain Chromium + its system libs.
  Build a custom Blaxel image — `FROM node:20-slim` then install Chromium (`npx playwright
  install --with-deps chromium`, or `apt-get install -y chromium`) — and pass it as the
  `image:` of `createIfNotExists`. Launch Chrome with `--no-sandbox --headless
  --disable-dev-shm-usage` (it runs as root in a container). *(Alternative: install
  Chromium at job start — smaller image, slower per run.)*
- Output = **findings + suggested changes**, derived from the failing audits → mapped to
  the report stage's KPIs/chart (SEO score, issues found, fixes proposed).
- Final result `{ findings, suggestions }`. Maestro receives it, the page shows the
  `report` stage completing with `doneLabel: "Handed to Maestro"`, Maestro acknowledges.
  The POC does **not** execute the fixes (out of scope).

> **Future — hosting is a router, not one vendor.** This POC hosts every generated site on
> Cloudflare Pages because they're static. In production, Nic routes **by app type**:
> **Cloudflare** for static and SSR/edge apps (Pages/Workers), **Railway** for apps that need
> a persistent always-on server or an arbitrary container/Docker runtime. The job contract
> doesn't change — Nic just returns a durable `url`; the host behind it is chosen per build.
> (Out of scope for the POC; noted so the Daytona→Cloudflare swap reads as the first leg of
> that router.)

## 4. Explicit cuts (do NOT build these)
- **Multi-tenancy, auth** — one hard-coded demo (`custombasketball`, 5 jerseys), no users.
- **The brain repo / `dashboard.json` / catalog** — none. Briefs are composed in code.
- **plan/apply gate + broker** — Max *suggests*; nothing is executed. No approval card.
- **Durable-orchestration extras** — keep the `jobs` state machine + `results`; skip the
  outbox/inbox, leases, retries, reconciliation sweep.
- **agent-cli-kit** — CLIs use a minimal hand-rolled helper, not the full kit.
- **Run-tracking UI / cost accounting** — none, no dashboard. Run history *is* the Neon
  `jobs`/`results` tables (status, durations, errors, outputs — query them directly);
  **spend is `stripe projects spend`** (by provider). Don't build either.

What we **do** build (don't cut): the always-on Maestro, Postgres job state, the job
contract, the signed webhook round trip, and **Blaxel sandboxes** for the specialists.

---

## 5. Build order
1. **Scaffold** `app/` (one npm project: TypeScript, Node 20, tsx).
2. **Provision via Stripe Projects:** `stripe plugin install projects` → `projects init`
   → `projects add neon` → `projects add render` → `projects add blaxel` →
   `projects env --pull` (lands `DATABASE_URL`, Blaxel creds). **Cloudflare is not a Stripe
   Projects vendor** — create a Cloudflare API token scoped **Pages: Edit**, note the
   **Account ID**, and set `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` + `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` in Maestro's
   Render env (Pages free tier — nothing to track in `stripe projects spend`).
3. **Maestro core + deploy:** Express + Neon (`jobs`, `results` + the state machine) +
   `POST /api/run`, `GET /api/events` (SSE), and the **signed webhook** `POST
   /api/jobs/:id/ingest`. **Deploy to Render** so the webhook has a public URL.
4. **Recreate the Process Steps page** in live mode; drive its controller from the SSE
   stream (prove it with fake events first).
5. **The `nic build` CLI:** generate `custombasketball` (5 jerseys) → deploy `./dist` to
   Cloudflare Pages (`wrangler`, durable `*.pages.dev` URL) → POST `log`/`data`/`complete`
   events + final `{ url }` to the callback.
6. **The `max audit` CLI:** Lighthouse the Cloudflare Pages URL → POST `report`-stage events
   + final `{ findings, suggestions }`.
7. **Blaxel wiring:** Maestro creates a Blaxel sandbox per job (`@blaxel/core`), injects the
   brief + secrets, `exec`s the CLI, tears it down on result. (Max's image is Chrome-capable.)
8. **Wire the callback:** Maestro passes its public **Render URL** as `callback_url` in
   each job request; the Blaxel sandboxes post events/results straight there.

---

## 6. Definition of done
- Click **Create the website** → Maestro fires Nic, then Max — each in its **own Blaxel
  sandbox** — and the **`jobs` table shows the two jobs** moving through the state machine.
- Nic builds `custombasketball` (5 jerseys), deploys it to **Cloudflare Pages**, and yields
  a **real, durable live URL** that survives past the end of the run.
- Max audits the URL with **Lighthouse** → findings + suggestions; **POSTs a signed
  result** to Maestro, which records it and acknowledges "would execute".
- The page narrates it **live** (`build` then `report` stages) from the real streamed
  events, and **looks like** `Process Steps v2.html`.

---

## 7. Locked stack & vendors — no guessing

Build exactly this; don't substitute.

| Concern | Locked choice |
|---|---|
| Provisioning · creds · billing | **Stripe Projects** — `add neon`, `add render`, `add blaxel`; `env --pull`. *(success #2)* (Cloudflare Pages is separate — a direct, free account.) |
| Maestro's store | **Neon Postgres** via Stripe Projects — `jobs` + `results` tables + the state machine. |
| Specialist sandbox | **Blaxel** (`@blaxel/core`) — ephemeral, one sandbox per job (`createIfNotExists` → `process.exec` → `delete`). Provisioned via Stripe Projects. Max's image is **Chrome-capable**. |
| Generated-site host | **Cloudflare Pages** (`wrangler` direct upload; `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` + `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` — a direct Cloudflare account, **not** Stripe Projects). Nic deploys `./dist` to a per-run project `cb-<job_id>` → durable CDN URL `https://cb-<job_id>.pages.dev`. |
| Language · runtime · pkg-mgr | **TypeScript** · **Node 20** · **`tsx`** · **npm**. |
| Maestro service | **Express** + **SSE** (`/api/run`, `/api/events`) + a **signed webhook** (`/api/jobs/:id/ingest`). **Deployed to Render** via Stripe Projects (public URL — sandboxes post straight to it, no tunnel). |
| The page | **The design, recreated as-is** — React + Babel from CDN, no build step; live mode. |
| Nic | CLI `nic build` (in a Blaxel sandbox); **hard-coded** `custombasketball` (5 jerseys); deploys the site to **Cloudflare Pages**. |
| Max | CLI `max audit` (in a Chrome-capable Blaxel sandbox); **Lighthouse** → suggestions. |
| Job contract | Request `{ job_id, agent, task, brief, callback_url }` + HMAC secret → **HMAC-signed** events + final `{ok,data,error,meta}` to Maestro's webhook. |

**Accounts that must exist:** Neon, Render, Blaxel **(via Stripe Projects** — confirm catalog
refs with `stripe projects catalog <name>`**)**, plus a **Cloudflare** account (Pages, free —
direct, not via Stripe Projects). Blaxel needs a Node-20 base image — and for Max, a
**Chrome-capable** one (see Max, above).
